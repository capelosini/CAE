## TODO:
- Transform the current Game Object Linked List to a generic Linked List and their operations too, so that you can use Linked Lists for other cases like fonts or UI elements.
- Add a way to detect collisions and stop the object from moving inside other objects that have collision enabled too, also put in the game object struct the collision side.
